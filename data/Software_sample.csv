Starts off with ""what is HTML"" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on ""the best way to lay out a site using CSS"" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.

She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.

She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.

UI - at the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

All in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.",A good value,1287360000,,

For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.

On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.

It's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)

As I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.",A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5,1287532800,,

It is very detailed and very clear.
The instructions with the graph and the audio and the video playback is very nice.
You can cut or repeat any lesson you need and come back and review at your convenience.
The lesson starts with very fundamental knowledge of what an URL is and allow the students to know what is the source code, the layout and how to use the tools and maneuver in the Dreamweaver app.
It is an excellent tool to have.
Most of us uses some of the tools but not all of the tools.  Some I don't even know the function was there.
It is nice to have a teacher like this I can go to easily without calling expensive tech support.
Highly recommend this teaching series.",excellent video training material,1302134400,,

It allows you to work with the software while watching and following the directions of instructor Candyce Mairs.  To me, the book is more of a reference guide, something I would access with a specific need or question, because overall I learn better by seeing and doing than by reading.

Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.

The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.

I'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.
At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version. So I recommend it.",Great Video for a Difficult at Times Program,1294444800,,

This video in comparison is quite a bit better in terms of the rich contents and course layout. The video has 17 sections covering the key elements of CS5 which allow the user to learn how to create a local web site from scratch and uploading it to the server. Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.

There are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.

I bought a few books, did some Lynda courses and still found myself wanting more. This was the perfect product for that ""more"".

I think some reviewers are confused about both Dreamweaver and this product - these aren't for ""design"". If you don't already know what you want to do, picking up Dreamweaver is not going to help! The product being reviewed here is how to use Dreamweaver - not how to design for the web. Both expect you already have the design part.

I used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. You'll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it's also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that's where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in. It very clearly takes you through learning DW so that you can get on with designing web pages.

Excellent addition to my library and excellent companion to Dreamweaver itself. The only other thing you might need is one of the large reference books on DW to refer back to if you have questions.",Excellent Tutorials!,1286409600,,
